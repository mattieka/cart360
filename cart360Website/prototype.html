        <h2>Keeper's Assistant: Prototype Response</h2>

          Admittedly, there was a gaping hole in my proposal in terms of how the Keeper’s Assistant would be experienced as an artifact. I got caught up in the components necessary to make the Keeper’s Assistant’s functions work on a breadboard. Initially, I had imagined it as something similar to a Dungeon Master Screen, but restricting myself to some vertical panels didn’t allow for any creativity in terms of use and presentation.
          </p>
        <p>
              After a lot of thinking, I settled on the idea of making the Keeper’s Assistant into something resembling a Grimoire. The expansion rulebook for Monster of the Week is titled “The Tome of Mysteries”, so I felt that this would be a good fit thematically. A big thick book in front of the Keeper that they flip through throughout the game jives really well with the atmosphere of playing through a supernatural mystery. The unwieldy buttons, wires, and other components would be swapped for conductive ink and tape instead, except for the 7-Segment, LEDs, speaker, and LCD for the Bystander Generator. A “stylus” dressed up as a feathered quill would have conductive ink on the tip to tap the “buttons”
          </p>
          <p>
            I moved forward with this idea and started to work on a low-fidelity cardboard prototype. I didn’t have the materials on-hand to make a version where the functions are implemented, but I wanted to at least see if the physical layout of my project would feel intuitive when in the form of “pages” of a “book”.
            </p>
          <p>
            I made the front cover and one “character” page out of cardboard to test how it would feel to handle the Keeper’s Assistant in this form.
            </p>
        <p>
          The overall form of the Keeper’s Assistant as a grimoire was really satisfying to me. I think I’m on the right track in creating something that feels like a natural part of playing Monster of the Week. Each “page” is made up of two pieces of cardboard. One is a “frame” that sticks to the “backing” piece with velcro. The components are mounted on the “backing”, with the frame fitting over the top. This would make it so that components like LEDs wouldn’t get crushed between pages.
          </p>
        <p>
          As happy as I am with this idea, it still needs a lot of polishing. As I was assembling the cardboard pages, I realized that I’d never thought about how I would bind the pages together. By the end, I had a couple of loose pages and no obvious place to connect them. I contemplated puncturing holes in the pages and using keychain loops or brass fasteners to keep them together, but that led me to the next problem: cardboard is flimsy, and would certainly deteriorate with time. I had to be careful not to be too rough with the pages, especially the frame piece, which risked being torn while being removed from the backing. Puncturing holes in the pages to bind them together would make this problem worse.
          </p>
        <p>
          I still have yet to experiment with implementing any circuitry into the pages. Unfortunately, by the time the idea of the grimoire came to me, it was too late to order any materials. I still have a lot of work cut out for me, so the next step will be prioritizing features that I’m confident I can actually finish. Not much has changed about the Keeper’s Assistant in terms of functionality, but due to time constraints and limited programming knowledge, I won’t be able to get each function that I’d planned up and running. My main worry was that this Grimoire version of the Keeper’s Assistant wouldn’t involve the player very much other than having a visual representation of their character’s dwindling health. In the end though, I don’t mind so much: its main purpose is to help the Keeper, after all.
