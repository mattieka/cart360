          This project was yet another instance where I deeply underestimate how much time and how much troubleshooting it takes to get a functioning project. As it stands, this second version of the Keeper’s Assistant is not working correctly: there’s something wrong with the way the circuit is built. I copied the one I had made for my first Prototype, so it’s likely that there’s a problem with the connections between components.
        </p>

          In terms of how the artifact looks, I’m mostly pleased with the improvement between version one and version two: I had the idea of keeping the “pages” in a three-ring binder, and building the general functions page directly into the inside cover. Cutting “lanes” into the foam was successful, and I liked working with the conductive paint, but getting the rest of the wires to cooperate was a nightmare.
        </p>

          I wish I had been able to get even half of the functions I wanted running. I think this would be a good project to return to after I have more experience with both the materials for building a circuit and the programming that goes into the arduino.
